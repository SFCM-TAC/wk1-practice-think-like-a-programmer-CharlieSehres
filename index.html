    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      - Create variable for input MIDI number <br>
      - Add plus and/or minus to the variable depending on what harmony I wanted <br>
      - Take numbers created in this way and output to MIDI <br>

      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Piano <br>
      - Keys are defined by "key" followed by a number, 1 through 88, e.g. "key49" <br>
      - Keys output "playPitch" and a number between 1 and 88 based on event "press" <br>
      - Properties such as "sustain" and "dampen" would corelate to how long a press lasts <br>
      - event "pedal" would overide any "dampen" commands <br>
      - Numbers 1 through 88 correlate to "frequencie" which sounds at the correct frequency
